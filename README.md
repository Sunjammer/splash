# Splash
Splash is a NodeJS CLI utility that lets you store a map of aliases to directories and quickly copy their contents elsewhere. That's it. 

# Usage:

Map the cwd to a name:
`splash map blargh`

Copy that dir somewhere else:

`splash blargh my/cool/directory`

...or to the cwd

`splash blargh`
